We have 6 folders that hold the main logic:

1. __Business__ - Holds the business logic for business accounts
2. __Factory__  - Holds contracts that will help users and business deploy their accounts(contracts)
3. __Mock__ - Just for testing purposes
4. __Shakesco__ - Holds contracts that shakesco offers to both businesses and indivisual
5. __Users__ - Holds logic for users accounts

### Deploy

---

We used hardhat for deployment. To learn more: [__Hardhat__](https://hardhat.org/tutorial "Hardhat Tutorial")

Contracts have been deployed on both mainnet and testnet.

- _Mumbai_ and _mainnet_ for __Polygon__
- _Sepolia_ and _mainnet_ for __Ethereum__

After cloning try:
> ðŸ’¡Tip: Run `npm install` to add hardhat locally

```shell
npx hardhat deploy
```

For deployment on testnet or mainnet:

```shell
npx hardhat deploy --network <network of choice>
```

### Tests

---

Test had to be done in two ways to save cost:

- Tests done locally that don't require userop
- Test on useop have been done with [__Stackup__](https://docs.stackup.sh/docs "StackupAPI")
  
> ðŸ’¡Tip: For this section you need api keys from either [__Alchemy__](https://www.alchemy.com/learn/account-abstraction "AlchemyAA") or [__StackUp__](https://docs.stackup.sh/docs "StackUpAA"). We recommend Stackup.

After getting your apikeys:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```
